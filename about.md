I am an accredited integrative counsellor offering individual and couple therapy in South East London. I draw on different theories and ideas in my work. Counselling can give you a safe space to explore the difficult and painful elements of your life to try and make more sense of them and work towards change. Whatever troubles you are facing, I will try and support you to reach a place where life feels more settled and meaningful. I work to a strict code of ethics and abide by the BACP's Ethical Framework, for whom I am an accredited and registered member. I have over 10 years' experience of working with a variety of services and people from all different backgrounds. I am also accredited with the Foundation for Infant Loss
